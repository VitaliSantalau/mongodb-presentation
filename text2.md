How can we create a database, a collection, a document to store our data?

The simplest way it is use a insertOne() method.

The insertOne() method has the following syntax:


If a database does not exist, MongoDB creates the database when you first store data for that database.
If a collection does not exist, MongoDB creates the collection when you first store data for that collection.
It is our document, where we store data.

And of course all set of CRUD operations.

Sharding
Indexes
Ok.

So, where we can use mongoDB?
One of the usage stacks is MERN.
